Cognitive Surveillance: Advancing Wildlife Monitoring and Property Security through Vision-Based Systems

Developed a cutting-edge system integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5 to revolutionize wildlife monitoring and property security.

Key Achievements:

•Developed a system utilizing Convolutional neural network (CNN) and You only look once
   (YOLO) v5 to identify and detect Wild Animals.

•Designed the system to effectively handle robust recognition in various environments.
•Leveraged Python Programming language to build the system and generated a
   comprehensive Training dataset to detect the specific set of wild animals.

•Implemented a Custom Deep learning network, crafting the architecture by defining neural
    connections and nodes to optimize accuracy and performance.
